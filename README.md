# Disciplr Contracts

Soroban smart contracts for [Disciplr](https://github.com/your-org/Disciplr): programmable time-locked USDC vaults on Stellar.

## What it does

Single contract **disciplr-vault** with:

- **Data model:** `ProductivityVault` (creator, amount, start/end timestamps, milestone hash, optional verifier, success/failure destinations, status).
- **Status:** `Active`, `Completed`, `Failed`, `Cancelled`.
- **Methods (stubs):**
  - `create_vault(...)` — create vault and emit `vault_created` (USDC lock is TODO).
  - `validate_milestone(vault_id)` — verifier validates milestone (release logic TODO).
  - `release_funds(vault_id)` — release to success destination (TODO).
  - `redirect_funds(vault_id)` — redirect to failure destination (TODO).
  - `cancel_vault(vault_id)` — cancel and return to creator (TODO).
  - `get_vault_state(vault_id)` — return vault state (returns `Option`; placeholder returns `None`).

This repo is a **basic version**: logic is stubbed and storage is not persisted. Use it as a starting point for full implementation (USDC token integration, persistence, timestamp checks, auth).

# Contract Documentation

## Overview

The Disciplr Vault is a Soroban smart contract deployed on the Stellar blockchain that enables **programmable time-locked USDC vaults** for productivity-based milestone funding. It allows creators to lock USDC tokens with specific milestones and conditions, ensuring funds are only released upon verified completion or redirected to a failure destination if milestones are not met.

### Use Cases

- **Vesting schedules**: Lock tokens that vest over time based on milestone completion
- **Grant funding**: Enable grant providers to fund projects with accountability
- **Team incentives**: Align team compensation with deliverable completion
- **Bug bounties**: Create time-bound bounty programs with predefined payout conditions

---

## Data Model

### VaultStatus Enum

Represents the current state of a vault:

```rust
#[contracttype]
pub enum VaultStatus {
    Active = 0,      // Vault created and funds locked
    Completed = 1,  // Milestone validated, funds released to success destination
    Failed = 2,     // Milestone not completed by deadline, funds redirected
    Cancelled = 3,  // Vault cancelled by creator, funds returned
}
```

| Status | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `Active` | Vault is live, waiting for milestone validation or deadline |
| `Completed` | Milestone verified, funds released to success destination |
| `Failed` | Deadline passed without validation, funds redirected |
| `Cancelled` | Creator cancelled vault, funds returned |

### ProductivityVault Struct

The main data structure representing a vault:

```rust
#[contracttype]
pub struct ProductivityVault {
    pub creator: Address,           // Address that created the vault
    pub amount: i128,                // Amount of USDC locked (in stroops)
    pub start_timestamp: u64,       // Unix timestamp when vault becomes active
    pub end_timestamp: u64,          // Unix deadline for milestone validation
    pub milestone_hash: BytesN<32>, // SHA-256 hash of milestone requirements
    pub verifier: Option<Address>,  // Optional trusted verifier address
    pub success_destination: Address, // Address for fund release on success
    pub failure_destination: Address, // Address for fund redirect on failure
    pub status: VaultStatus,        // Current lifecycle state of the vault
}
```

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `creator` | `Address` | Wallet address that created the vault |
| `amount` | `i128` | Total USDC amount locked (in stroops, 1 USDC = 10^7 stroops) |
| `start_timestamp` | `u64` | Unix timestamp (seconds) when vault becomes active |
| `end_timestamp` | `u64` | Unix timestamp (seconds) deadline for milestone validation |
| `milestone_hash` | `BytesN<32>` | SHA-256 hash documenting milestone requirements |
| `verifier` | `Option<Address>` | Optional trusted party who can validate milestones |
| `success_destination` | `Address` | Recipient address on successful milestone completion |
| `failure_destination` | `Address` | Recipient address when milestone is not completed |
| `status` | `VaultStatus` | Current lifecycle state of the vault |

## Security and Trust Model

The Disciplr Vault contract is designed with specific security guarantees and trust assumptions:

- **Verifier Trust**: Designated verifiers have absolute power over milestone validation.
- **Immutable Destinations**: success/failure destinations cannot be changed once the vault is created.
- **USDC Address Risk**: The contract does not pin the USDC token address; it must be verified by callers during interaction.

For a comprehensive analysis of the security model, assumptions, and known limitations, please refer to the [detailed security documentation in vesting.md](vesting.md#security-and-trust-model).

---

## Usage Examples

### Example 1: Create a Milestone-Based Funding Vault

A project owner wants to lock 1000 USDC for a bug bounty program with a 30-day deadline.

```rust
// Parameters
let creator: Address = Address::from_string("GA7..."); // Creator wallet
let amount: i128 = 1000 * 10_000_000; // 1000 USDC in stroops
let start_timestamp: u64 = 1704067200; // Jan 1, 2024 00:00:00 UTC
let end_timestamp: u64 = 1706640000;    // Jan 30, 2024 00:00:00 UTC (30 days)

// Hash of milestone requirements (off-chain document)
let milestone_hash: BytesN<32> = BytesN::from_array(&env, &[
    0x4d, 0x69, 0x6c, 0x65, 0x73, 0x74, 0x6f, 0x6e,
    0x65, 0x5f, 0x72, 0x65, 0x71, 0x75, 0x69, 0x72,
    0x65, 0x6d, 0x65, 0x6e, 0x74, 0x73, 0x5f, 0x68,
    0x61, 0x73, 0x68, 0x5f, 0x65, 0x78, 0x61, 0x6d
]);

let verifier: Option<Address> = Some(Address::from_string("GB7..."));
let success_destination: Address = Address::from_string("GC7..."); // Project wallet
let failure_destination: Address = Address::from_string("GD7..."); // Funder wallet

// Create vault
let vault_id = DisciplrVaultClient::new(&env, &contract_address)
    .create_vault(
        &creator,
        &amount,
        &start_timestamp,
        &end_timestamp,
        &milestone_hash,
        &verifier,
        &success_destination,
        &failure_destination,
    );
// vault_id = 0
```

### Example 2: Validate Milestone and Release Funds

The verifier validates that milestone requirements were met and releases funds.

```rust
let verifier: Address = Address::from_string("GB7..."); // Designated verifier

let result = DisciplrVaultClient::new(&env, &contract_address)
    .with_source_account(&verifier)
    .validate_milestone(&vault_id);
// result = true

// Funds now transferred to success_destination
// Vault status changed to Completed
```

### Example 3: Handle Deadline Without Validation

After the deadline passes without milestone validation, funds are redirected.

```rust
// Assume end_timestamp has passed and no validation occurred

let result = DisciplrVaultClient::new(&env, &contract_address)
    .redirect_funds(&vault_id);
// result = true

// Funds transferred to failure_destination
// Vault status changed to Failed
```

### Example 4: Cancel Vault Before Deadline

Creator decides to cancel the vault before the deadline.

```rust
let creator: Address = Address::from_string("GA7..."); // Original creator

let result = DisciplrVaultClient::new(&env, &contract_address)
    .with_source_account(&creator)
    .cancel_vault(&vault_id);
// result = true

// Funds returned to creator
// Vault status changed to Cancelled
```

### Example 5: Query Vault State

Check the current state of a vault.

```rust
let vault_state = DisciplrVaultClient::new(&env, &contract_address)
    .get_vault_state(&vault_id);

// Returns Some(ProductivityVault) or None
match vault_state {
    Some(vault) => {
        // Access vault fields
        let current_status = vault.status;
        let amount_locked = vault.amount;
    }
    None => {
        // Vault not found or not initialized
    }
}
```

## Merging into a Remote

This directory is a separate git repo. To push to your own remote:

```bash
cd disciplr-contracts
git remote add origin <your-disciplr-contracts-repo-url>
git push -u origin main
```

## Security and Testing

### Security Notes

- **Timestamp Validation**: Milestone validation is strictly prohibited once the ledger timestamp reaches or exceeds `end_timestamp`. This prevents "late" validations and ensures the time-lock is honored.
- **Authentication**: `validate_milestone` requires authorization from the verifier (if specified) or the creator. This ensures only authorized parties can progress the vault state.
- **State Integrity**: Operations like `validate_milestone`, `release_funds`, and `cancel_vault` check the current `status` (must be `Active`) to prevent double-spending or invalid state transitions.

### Test Coverage

The project includes unit tests for core logic, specifically:
- Verification of milestone rejection after `end_timestamp`.
- Verification of successful milestone validation before `end_timestamp`.

To run tests:
```bash
cargo test
```
